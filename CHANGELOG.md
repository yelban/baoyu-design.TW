# Changelog

All notable changes to `baoyu-design` are tracked in this file.

## Unreleased

### Added

- Added a local Figma `.fig` importer (`agents/import-figma.mjs`) that decodes a file entirely offline — no Figma account or MCP needed — via the vendored decoder (`agents/vendor/fig-materialize.mjs`: kiwi schema + zstd/deflate, ZIP-container or raw files) and `agents/vendor/fflate.mjs`. Five subcommands: `outline` (read-only inventory of pages, frames, components, variables), `mount` (browsable read-only reference tree under `_fig/<slug>/` with per-frame JSX and a guid→path `node-index.json`), `materialize` (cherry-pick components/frames as flat React `.jsx` + `.d.ts` with their dependency closure, assets, and optional token/typography CSS), `render` (a frame as self-contained HTML for visual ground truth), and `design-system` (emit every component + variable into `designs/<slug>/` following the authoring convention, with `@kind`-annotated token CSS and a provenance README). Emitted filenames are deduped case-insensitively, so names differing only by case (e.g. the `MdAddChart`/`MdAddchart` icon pair) survive macOS/Windows case-insensitive filesystems instead of silently overwriting each other — and the writer warns if an on-disk collision ever happens anyway. Printed next-step commands are copy-pasteable (real script paths, shell-quoted arguments). The flow is documented in the new `import-from-figma.md` built-in skill and wired into `SKILL.md`, the system-prompt skill index, the authoring guide, and `send-to-figma.md`.
- Added the `design-system-preview` built-in skill (ported from claude-design-v2): `agents/build-preview.mjs` compiles a design system folder (its `_ds_manifest.json` cards, starting points, and `readme.md`) into one self-contained interactive `preview.html` — outline nav, rendered Readme, and scaled live cards isolated via declarative Shadow DOM, no iframes. Authoring flows (`design-system-authoring-guide.md`, `create-design-system.md`) now end by generating `preview.html` into the design-system directory, and it is documented as a generated artifact alongside `_ds_bundle.js`/`_ds_manifest.json`. React/ReactDOM UMDs are vendored into `agents/vendor/` so the default build is offline.
- Added end-to-end design-system support so a design project can follow an existing system: discovery, a sync step that copies a self‑contained, version‑pinned copy into `<project>/_ds/<slug>/`, page wiring, a generated per‑load binding prompt (`_ds_prompt.md`), and the binding recorded in `<project>/_d_meta.json` — documented in the new `use-design-system.md` built‑in skill.
- Added a portable design-system authoring pipeline: a compiler that bundles a system's tokens and React components for loading, a read-only checker (with a matching checker subagent) that validates a system without writing, and the `design-system-authoring-guide.md` flow.
- Added asset recording that indexes a project's deliverables and their review status in `_d_meta.json`, bootstrapping that metadata even when no design system is used.
- Added a read-only fork-verifier subagent (`agents/fork-verifier-agent.md`) for thorough post-build checks — it loads the served deliverable, catches console errors, screenshots the layout, and probes for overflow root causes and unresolved `var(--*)` tokens before returning a single done / needs-work verdict; the Claude Code, Cursor, and Codex harness references now resolve their `fork_verifier_agent` verification subagent to it.
- Added this changelog to keep project updates in one place.

### Changed

- `check-design-system.mjs` now caps the component inventory in its summary line at 40 names (then `… +N more — full list with --verbose`), so systems with thousands of imported components keep a readable verdict.
- Upgraded the generated per-load design-system prompt (`_ds/<slug>/_ds_prompt.md`) to the design-mode reference structure: a bundle-first wiring section that opens with the skill's pinned React/ReactDOM UMD tags and lists every stylesheet `<link>` in the `@import` closure plus the bundle `<script>` (plain compiled JS, loaded after React/ReactDOM — never `type="text/babel"`/`type="module"`), an explicit compose-with-the-bundle rule (don't recreate exported components or restyle raw HTML to imitate them), a destructure example using the system's real component names (constant-style exports such as `ICON_NAMES` are skipped as samples), a `type="text/babel"` + pinned Babel-standalone example showing how the page's own JSX is transpiled, the source-tree pointer ahead of the inlined guide, and a new `<ds-prompt-excerpts>` block reproducing the first lines of each component's `*.prompt.md` (those files aren't bound into `_ds/`). CSS-only and zero-component systems degrade to stylesheet-led wording; the import script's printed wiring report now matches the prompt, and `use-design-system.md` plus the core workflow document the new wiring.
- The design-system compiler now also exposes PascalCase exports of `.jsx`/`.tsx` files that lack a sibling `.d.ts` on `window.<Namespace>` (collision-guarded — a `.d.ts`-backed component always keeps its name), so such files are bundled and exported but carry no props contract, adherence rules, or starting-point eligibility.
- Expanded the authoring guide's GitHub source-import flow into concrete steps: browse a repo tree with `gh api` without cloning, sparse-checkout only the needed path prefixes into a scratch dir outside the design-system folder (a clone inside it would pollute compiler discovery), and stop to ask the user when a repo is private or unreachable.
- Aligned component authoring docs with the compiler: components import React only and may import siblings with relative paths (the compiler strips/rewrites these at bundle time); `app.css` is documented as an accepted global-CSS entry name.
- Project setup now asks where to save the project and which design system(s) to use (none, one, or several); reopening a project reloads its bound design systems from `_d_meta.json` before designing.
- Documented importing and using existing design systems in the English and Simplified Chinese README files.
- Clarified that final design and prototype delivery should include the running preview, not only the generated file.
- Updated Claude Code, Codex Agent, and Cursor harness references to make final preview handoff visible to the user after verification.
- Updated the English and Simplified Chinese README files to document Codex Agent support, the new `references/codex.md` harness map, install examples, usage notes, and changelog links.

### Fixed

- Fixed the design-system compiler emitting bundle source blocks in alphabetical order: the bundle rewrites relative imports into eager destructuring, so a component whose local dependency sorted later (e.g. `Button` importing `Icon`) read `undefined` at load time. Blocks are now emitted in dependency-safe DFS post-order, with the old alphabetical order kept as a stable tie-break (cycles fall back to it).
- `build-preview.mjs` no longer prints the same "no usable manifest" line for two different situations: a missing manifest now says to run `compile-design-system.mjs` first, while a manifest with no cards, starting points, or templates says exactly that — both before falling back to the `@dsCard` file scan.
- Fixed the compiler's token extraction mis-reading BEM-with-pseudo-class CSS rules (e.g. `.s2-btn--primary:hover { … }`) as custom-property declarations, which produced phantom tokens like `--primary` in `_ds_manifest.json`; declaration matches whose value contains a brace are now skipped (`agents/lib/ds-core.mjs`).
- The generated `preview.html` now forces `color-scheme: light` on the page and on every card host, so design systems using `light-dark()` tokens render light inside the light pane chrome instead of following the viewer's OS dark mode (explicitly dark subtrees still render dark; systems keyed off `prefers-color-scheme` media queries remain a documented limit).
- Card previews in `preview.html` no longer show scrollbars when content overflows the declared viewport — overflow stays scrollable but the scrollbar chrome is hidden via a base stylesheet injected into each card's shadow root.
- Card previews in `preview.html` no longer clip content taller than the declared viewport: the declared height now acts as a minimum and each card grows to its measured content height (re-measured as React commits, fetches resolve, images decode, and fonts load, with a monotonic guard and a 4000px cap so container-relative content can't ratchet the height forever). The card root also sizes as `border-box`, keeping body padding inside the declared viewport like a real page.
- Tall cards in `preview.html` no longer show a white band inside the right edge of their frame: card scaling is now width-only (`scale = min(containerWidth/designW, 1)`) instead of also clamping to a 500px max height — the height clamp shrank grown cards below the frame width, exposing the frame's white background — and the frame now shrink-wraps the scaled stage. The `--max-height` flag is gone with the clamp.
- Relative `fetch()` URLs in card scripts are now rebased to the card's source directory (cards are re-rooted into the single preview file), and when any card fetches, the project's small asset files (svg/png/json/… capped at 3 MB total) are inlined and served from memory — fixing icon/JSON fetches both over HTTP and file://, where they previously 404'd or were CORS-blocked.

## 2026-06-06

### Added

- Added Codex Agent support with `skills/baoyu-design/references/codex.md`, covering question asking, browser preview, screenshots, debugging, deliverable surfacing, and subagent verification defaults.
- Added English and Simplified Chinese README files.
- Added the portable `baoyu-design` Agent Skill, core design methodology, built-in skill prompts, starter components, and harness reference docs for Claude Code and Cursor.
- Added the initial repository files and MIT license.

### Changed

- Updated the skill entry flow to detect Codex Agent and fall back cleanly for Claude Desktop-like or other file-capable harnesses.
- Reworded preview and verification instructions in built-in export skills so they route through the selected harness reference instead of hard-coded preview tool names.
